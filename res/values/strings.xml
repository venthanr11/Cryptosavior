    <string name="features">Features</string>
    <string name="features_text">CryptoSavior offers a comfortable and secure way to keep
        files with confidential data encrypted. It uses AES encryption. A MasterKey is 
        used to access the application and to encrypt the files as well.</string>
    <string name="features_text1">Confidential files are accessible directly in a list
        after the login. With one click on the file, an option to open the file with appropriate
        application is provided along with an option to decrypt as well. The file can be encrypted 
        back after viewing.</string>    
    <string name="features_text2">The Original file is over-written with random bytes before 
        deletion, after the encryption process is over. As a result, even in case of lost or 
        stolen device, the original file can not be retrieved back with "File Recovery tools".</string>
    <string name="master_key">Master Key</string>
    <string name="master_key_text">The MasterKey, as the name suggests is the central key to 
        access the application and encrypt the files as well. It is highly recommended that a longer key is
        used as a MasterKey and be kept safe. If one forgets the Key, all encrypted files will be 
        lost.</string>
    <string name="secure">How secure is CryptoSavior?</string>
    <string name="secure_text">We can ensure the security of CryptoSavior by looking at the following likely scenarios
        that can happen:</string>
    <string name="secure_text1">1) The Device is attacked by a malicious app, with rights to read
        the SD card contents.\n
        2)The SD card is lost or stolen.\n
        3)The Device is lost or stolen along with the SD card.</string>
    <string name="secure_text2">If the attacker has access only to the encrypted files(Scenario 1), 
        extreme computing power and ages of time to decrypt the files using brute-force methods. 
        If the attacker has direct access to the SD card or Phone(Scenario 2 and 3), he is required
        to have root privileges and it is totally dependent on the length of the MasterKey. So it
        is highly recommended that a lengthy key is used with no compromise for security with regard
        to comfort.</string>
